# AGI

Resources I have found useful in my journey of [AGI](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/shoggoth-with-smiley-face-artificial-intelligence). I have a biase towards NLP/LLM since it is a focus of mine. I will try to update other sections in due course. Please feel free to contribute. 


* [Large Language Models (LLM)](llm/README.md)
* Vision Foundation Models (To come)
* Multimodal Foundation Models (To come)
* [RL + Foundational Models](planning/README.md)
