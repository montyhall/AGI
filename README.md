# AGI

Resources I have found useful in my journey of [AGI](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/shoggoth-with-smiley-face-artificial-intelligence). I have a biase towards NLP/LLM since it is a focus of mine. I will try to update other sections in due course. Please feel free to contribute. 


* [Large Language Models (LLM)](llm/README.md)
* Vision Foundation Models (To come)
* [Multimodal Foundation Models](mmodal/README.md)
* [RL + Foundational Models](planning/README.md)

# Macro views

* [Stanford's HELM](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/latest/) Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) is a living benchmark that aims to improve the transparency of language models. [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.09110.pdf)
* [A Cookbook of Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.12210.pdf)
* [Ecosystem graphs](https://crfm.stanford.edu/ecosystem-graphs/) `framework to document the foundation models ecosystem, namely both the assets (datasets, models, and applications) and their relationships.`
